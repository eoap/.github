# Resources and Guides for Earth Observation Application Packages

This set of repositories aim to:

* help developers create Earth Observation (EO) applications using the Common Workflow Language (CWL)
* provide an overview of the CWL, its key concepts
* how to build a CWL-based EO application using practical examples in field guides

Many cloud-based solutions for workflows in EO are available to users today, but only few support reproducibility or comply with FAIR data principles. 

This short tutorial demonstrates how EO Application Packages meet these requirements.
